    "answer": "Yes, the context of RFPs can include criteria that exceed typical expectations, such as proposals that are considered \"Exceptional,\" which indicates a high level of innovation and superiority. Additionally, proposals must be complete and adhere strictly to the specified requirements; any deviation can lead to a proposal being rated as a Fail. These aspects can make the RFP process more complex than just meeting standard norms."
