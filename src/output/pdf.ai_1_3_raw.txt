In the context of RFPs, there are a few aspects that may not be straightforward or normal:
Specific Proposal Requirements: The RFP outlines detailed requirements for proposers to follow, including specific sections to be included in the proposal and how they should be structured.

Evaluation Criteria: The document provides a clear breakdown of how proposals will be evaluated, including scoring criteria for different sections such as completeness of response, vendor profile, solution and work plan, etc.

Certifications and Documentation: Proposers are required to include various certifications and documentation, such as the Responsible Bidder Attestation, Underrepresented Business letter, Veteran-Owned Business Letter, and more.

Steering Committee Involvement: The requirement for sign-off from the Steering Committee at each milestone indicates a structured and formalized decision-making process throughout the project.

Scoring Tool: The inclusion of a Scoring Tool in the RFP package suggests a systematic approach to evaluating and comparing proposals based on predefined criteria.
