Based on the RFP document, here are the key deliverables for the mobile app development project:

1. Mobile Application Development
   The Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) will be creating a mobile application that provides real-time information about Covid-19 prevention, surveillance, and resources to Boston residents. The project will involve two distinct phases:
   1) Solicit Community Input, Identify Features and Functionality, Organize and Assemble Content
   2) Mobile Application Development

2. Front-End Interface Features
   The front-end interface will have three or more tabs/buttons:
   - A form to gather input from residents regarding Covid-19 symptoms
   - Real-time information on testing and vaccine information
   - Real-time information on treatment protocols
   - Cited text: "7\r\nFront End Interface\r\nThe functions of the front-end user will be based on audience and staff feedback, surveillance,\r\nresource, privacy, and HIPAA compliance. The interface will have three or more tabs or buttons. \r\n1. a form to gather input from residents regarding covid-19 symptoms.\r\n2. Real-time information on testing and vaccine information. \r\n3. Real-time information on treatment protocols.\r\n"

3. Administrative Functions
   Administrative functions will include:
   - Ability for administrators to update or refresh content within the app
   - Ability to edit or update app features and front-end interface
   - Ability to add, remove, and update data on the site as information is learned in the community
   - Cited text: "Administrative Functions\r\nThese are functions that the application administrators will use and interact with.\r\nBPHC wishes to have one or more administrative staff who can control several functions:\r\n• Administrators should be able to update or refresh content with the app. \r\n• Administrators should be able to edit or update app features and front-end interface.\r\n• Administrators wish to add, remove, and update data on the site as they learn of them in the\r\ncommunity.\r\n"

4. Technical Infrastructure
   The application should:
   - Be hosted on BPHC's Microsoft Azure cloud-hosted solutions
   - Be hardware agnostic, allowing users to view material on laptops, tablets, and mobile phones
   - Be available as downloadable applications on Apple and Google app stores
   - Cited text: "Infrastructure\r\nThe development team should host the application, on BPHC- Microsoft Azure cloud-hosted \r\nsolutions. It should be hardware agnostic, allowing users to view the material on their laptops, \r\ntablets, and mobile phones. They should also be available as downloadable applications on the \r\nrespective app stores (Apple and Google). The application should be packaged for release via the app \r\nstores.\r\n"

5. Analytics
   The developers are responsible for:
   - Configuring Google and Apple Analytics into the application
   - Providing standard reports on audience, acquisition, and user behavior
   - Ensuring reporting is human-readable (e.g., using meaningful names instead of URLs)
   - Tracking most frequently used queries and results
   - Cited text: "Analytics\r\nAdministrators wish to track the use of this application. The developers are responsible for \r\nconfiguring Google and Apple Analytics into the application. BPHC is interested in monitoring the \r\nstandard reports from Google and Apple Analytics on the audience, acquisition, and behavior of \r\nusers. We are not interested in explicitly knowing who these users are but in learning about the \r\nusers in aggregate. In addition, we would like the developers to configure their application and the \r\nanalytics so that reporting is human-readable. For example, when looking at the page title report, \r\nthe titles of the resources should be names, not URLs (“Locust Street Arts,” not \r\n“app/result/?id=5738”). BPHC is also interested in the most frequently used queries and how \r\nmany/what results are given.\r\n"

6. Translation and Accessibility Support
   The development team needs to include methods to:
   - Translate the app into other languages (through direct translation, technical means like Google Translate, or both)
   - Handle Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
   - Cited text: "In addition, BPHC would provide real-time information about Covid-19 prevention, \r\nsurveillance, and resource:\r\nTranslation and ADA Support\r\nIn order to support use of this app by all in Erie BPHC, the development team needs to include \r\nin their proposal methods to translate the app into other languages either through direct \r\ntranslation, technical means (similar to Google Translate), or both. In addition, please identify \r\nhow your development will handle the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \r\n(https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/designing/).\r\n"

The project has a tight timeline, with implementation due on May 30, 2023.
   - Cited text: "The development of this app will be swift\r\n- implementation is due on May 30, 2023. To succeed, the development team will quickly \r\ngather the functional requirements, subject matter resources (including branding materials and \r\nvisual design elements), and data to incorporate into the application by the deadline.\r\n"
